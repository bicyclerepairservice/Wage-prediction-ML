# Wage-prediction-ML
Wage prediction with the treatment effect of sports activities. Was completed as a part of the course "Machine Learning in Economics". Recieved a grade of 9.3/10

In this project I generate artificial data based on the assumptions from the literature to estimate treatment effects of sport activities on the wage of some group of workers.
